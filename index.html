	<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a first year PhD candidate of Computational Science and Engineering through the School of Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
    Prior to this, I was a student at the University of Georgia, where I earned degrees in Mathematics and Chemistry.
    In my free time, I enjoy reading, programming (primarily in Python), and playing the bass trombone.
