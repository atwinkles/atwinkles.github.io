<h1>A little about me...</h1>
    <p>
    I am a first year PhD candidate at the Georgia Institute for Technology, where I hope to explore research topics surrounding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis" target="_blank">Numerical Analysis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_engineering" target="_blank">Computational Science</a>.
    I appreciate the concept of designing computer simulations to study the world around us and look forward to contributing to the field in due time. 

    Before coming to Georgia Tech, I was engaged in several research activities at the University of Georgia. First and foremost, I was an undergraduate researcher for Professor Henry F. Schaefer at the <a href="http://www.ccqc.uga.edu" target="_blank">Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry</a>, where I found my initial passion for computational science. 
    After that, I divied up my time between the <a href="http://smallsat.uga.edu" target="_blank">Small Satellite Research Laboratory</a>, where I was a part of the SPOC mission's research team and working with <a href="http://www.jasoncantarella.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Jason Cantarella</a> in the mathematics department.
