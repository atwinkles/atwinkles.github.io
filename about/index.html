<h1>A little about me...</h1>
    <p>
    I am a first year PhD candidate at the Georgia Institute for Technology, where I hope to explore research topics surrounding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis" target="_blank">Numerical Analysis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_engineering" target="_blank">Computational Science</a>.
    I appreciate the concept of designing computer simulations to study the world around us and look forward to contributing to the field in due time.

    Before coming to Georgia Tech, I was engaged in several research activities at the University of Georgia. First and foremost, I was an undergraduate researcher for Professor Henry F. Schaefer at the <a href="http://www.ccqc.uga.edu" target="_blank">Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry</a>, where I found my initial passion for computational science. 
    After that, I divied up my time between the <a href="http://smallsat.uga.edu" target="_blank">Small Satellite Research Laboratory</a>, where I was a part of the SPOC mission's research team and working with <a href="http://www.jasoncantarella.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Jason Cantarella</a> in the mathematics department.

    In my spare time, I enjoy reading fantasy books such as <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com" target="_blank">Brandon Sanderson</a> and playing bass trombone, both in classical settings and jazz. 
    Some of my fondest memories of my life (as well as most of my close friends) can be connected with my time in music, and I plan to continue this passion as I go through life. 
    Besides reading and performing, I am an avid coder, and especially enjoy solving problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>.
    If you're looking for a challenge or a fun way to develop coding skills, I highly recommend making an account and giving it a whirl!
